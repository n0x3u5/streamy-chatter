# Streaming Chat
## Time Limit: 1 hour

### Challenge Instructions:

01. Use the `streamResponse` function to get a Promise to a ReadableStream response
02. Update the UI in expectation of the Promise resolving in response to a user's message
03. Display a "thinking" state while waiting for the stream
04. Handle any potential errors before the stream starts
05. Read the stream contents
06. Display the stream contents in real time as they arrive
07. Handle the completion of the stream
08. Bonus: Implement a way to cancel ongoing streams

You may add any additional features or optimizations if time allows.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct usage of Promises and Web Streams API
- Efficient state management and re-rendering in React
- Handling of "thinking" state and transition to streaming
- Handling of streaming response
- Error handling for both initial and/or mid-stream errors
